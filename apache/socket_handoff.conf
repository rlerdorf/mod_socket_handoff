# mod_socket_handoff configuration
#
# This module allows PHP (or any handler) to hand off client connections
# to an external daemon by setting response headers.
#
# Headers:
#   X-Socket-Handoff: /path/to/unix/socket
#   X-Handoff-Data: optional JSON data to pass to daemon

# Enable the filter
SocketHandoffEnabled On

# Security: Only allow sockets under this path prefix
# The module will reject any socket path that doesn't start with this prefix
SocketHandoffAllowedPrefix /var/run/

# Timeout (ms) for connecting to the handoff daemon socket
# Valid range: 1-60000 (1ms to 60 seconds)
# For high-traffic deployments, consider lowering to 100-200ms
SocketHandoffConnectTimeoutMs 500
